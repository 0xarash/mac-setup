# System Preferences

First thing you need to do, on any OS acutally, is update the system! For that: **Apple Icon > Software Update.**
Also upgrade your OS incase you got a machine with **Lion** installed on it. I got a free upgrade as I had purchased my machine after the Mountain Lion launch. 

If this is a new computer, there are a couple tweaks I like to make to the System Preferences. Feel free to follow these, or to ignore them, depending on your personal preferences.
