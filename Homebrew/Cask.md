# Homebrew Cask

Let's see if we can get the elegance, simplicity, and speed of Homebrew for the installation and management of GUI Mac applications such as Google Chrome and Adium.

### Install

Install Homebrew-cask is really straight forward. We just need to add the cask tap and then install brew cask.

    $ brew tap caskroom/cask
    $ brew install brew-cask
    $ brew cask install google-chrome
    $ brew update && brew upgrade brew-cask && brew cleanup

### Search

It is really simple to check if the app is supported by cask by going to the search page on [caskroom.io](http://caskroom.io/)

I'll now cover installation of the apps that I have mentioned in the apps section using cask.
